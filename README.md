# Weather-Buddy
The main goal of web application used for rapid implementation of climate change.

This web app provides real-time data from sensors with micro-controllers such  as esp-32.
This sensors can be placed around your surroundings and it shows the air quality. 
You can also see the real time AQI(Air Quality Index) rankings of the world in google maps.
The web provides the info regarding the local weather changes in your locality.

•	Providing real time data of climate issue zones.
•	Involving various field’s to work on climate change.
•	Providing locations of ongoing campaigns.

To run this web site you need run the index.html program in vs code editor and install live server extension in vs code and click on go live and you see the web app run.
